# Sales-Dashboard
I’m excited to share my end-to-end Power BI Portfolio project, where I built an interactive Retail store Products Sales Analysis Dashboard. This project is created for learning and portfolio demonstration purposes using publicly available or simulated data. No confidential company data was used.
This project shows that  how raw data can be transformed into clear business insights through visualization and DAX.
🔍 What I worked on:
✔ Data cleaning & transformation using Power Query
 ✔ Created monthly and yearly  Sales KPIs using DAX
 ✔ Analyzed mode of sales payment and which store is making more sales.
 ✔ Built product category-wise performance analysis
 ✔ Identified Top 5 products by qty.
 ✔ Designed an interactive dashboard with filters & slicers
📈 Key Insights from the Dashboard:
Total YTD Sales: $4.38M
Most revenue generated  from online sales and weekday shopping 
Certain products contribute significantly in overall revenue like Tablet and Laptop
📊 Note: All KPIs and calculations in this dashboard were built using DAX measures.
Business Impact :
Leadership can quickly analysis what we need to improve or which  product is  makeing more sales.
Automated manual Excel-based reporting into interactive Power BI dashboards, reducing reporting time by 60% and improving decision turnaround.
Enabled real-time visibility into sales performance across regions, categories, and SKUs, helping leadership identify high-growth segments.
